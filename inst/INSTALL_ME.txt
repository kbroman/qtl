INSTALL_ME file for the qtl package
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This explains the installation of the qtl package for R.  If you have
any problems with installation, send an email to Karl Broman
<broman@wisc.edu>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

OBTAINING R

  You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
  Visit https://cran.r-project.org or a local mirror (for example,
  https://cran.rstudio.com).  Source code is available for Unix,
  and binaries are available for Windows, MacOS, and many versions of
  Linux.


OBTAINING R/QTL

  You can obtain the latest version of R/qtl from

      https://rqtl.org

  Copies of R/qtl will also be placed on CRAN (cran.r-project.org).
  Binaries are available for Windows and MacOS; source code is
  available for Unix.


INSTALLATION OF R AND R/QTL (Windows)

  1. The Windows version of R is distributed as a single file, with a
     name something like R-4.1.1-win.exe.  Install R by executing
     this file.  We recommend installing R in "c:\R" rather than
     "c:\Program Files\R".  Why didn't Microsoft use "Programs" rather
     than "Program files"?

  2. To install R/qtl, the simplest approach is to start R and type

         install.packages("qtl")

     This will download the binary from CRAN and install it.

     Alternatively, you can download the "qtl_1.50.zip" (or the
     equivalent).  Then start R and select (on the menu bar)
     "Packages" and then "Install package from local zip file...".
     Find the file "qtl_1.50.zip" on your hard drive, and click
     "Open".


INSTALLATION OF R AND R/QTL (MacOS version 10.13 and above)

  1. Download the file R-4.1.1.pkg, double-click it, and follow the
     instructions.

  2. To install R/qtl, the simplest approach is to start R and type

         install.packages("qtl")

     This will download the binary from CRAN and install it.

     Alternatively, download the compiled version of R/qtl for
     Mac OS X, a file like "qtl_1.50.tgz".  Then start R and
     select (on the menu bar) "Packages & Data" -> "Package
     Installer".  Select "Local Binary Package" from the drop-down
     menu at the top of the window that comes up.  Click "Install"
     at the bottom of the window.  Find the package on your drive
     and click "Open".  Finally, close the window.


INSTALLATION OF R/QTL (Unix)

  1. We'll assume that R has already been installed.

  2. To install R/qtl, the simplest approach is to start R and
     type

         install.packages("qtl")

     This will download the binary from CRAN and install it.

     Alternatively, download the R/qtl source code (a file like
     "qtl_1.50.tar.gz").  Go into the directory containing the
     file and do one of the following:

     a. To install R/qtl in the standard location
        (/usr/local/lib/R/library), type

            R CMD INSTALL qtl_1.50.tar.gz

        You'll probably need to be superuser.

     b. To install the package locally, type

            R CMD INSTALL --library=/home/auser/Rlibs qtl_1.50.tar.gz

        (where "/home/auser/Rlibs" should be replaced with the
        appropriate directory).

        Create a file ~/.Renviron containing the line

            R_LIBS=/home/auser/Rlibs

        so that R will know to search for packages in that directory.


GETTING STARTED

  Once you start R, you'll need to type "library(qtl)" to load the
  package.  You can create a file "~/.Rprofile" (Unix or MacOS) or
  "c:\.Rprofile" (Windows) containing R code to be run whenever you
  start R.  If you use the R/qtl package regularly, you should place
  the line "library(qtl)" in such a file.

  Efficient use of the R/qtl package requires considerable knowledge
  of the R language.  Learning R may require a formidable investment
  of time, but it will definitely be worth the effort.  Numerous free
  documents on getting started with R are available on CRAN
  (https://cran.r-project.org).  In addition, several books are
  available.  For example, see WN Venables, BD Ripley (2002) Modern
  Applied Statistics with S, 4th edition. Springer.

  To get started with R/qtl, you might first peruse the documentation
  that is bundled with it.  Type help.start() to start the html
  version of the R help pages.  Then click "Packages" -> "qtl".

  In Windows or MacOS, you may gain access to the help documents by
  clicking "Help" in the menu bar and then "R language (html)".  If
  you include "options(htmlhelp=TRUE)" in your .Rprofile file, use of
  the html version of the help pages will be automatic.

  The help file titled "A starting point" gives a brief walk-through
  of an example analysis, and so is a good place to start.  You may
  also view this help file by typing

      ?"A starting point"

  from the command line in R.

  A tutorial on R/qtl (as a PDF document) is also available.  It
  briefly describes the aims of the R/qtl package, lists the available
  functions grouped in categories, and provides a few extended
  examples.  The tutorial is bundled with R/qtl, as "rqtltour.pdf" and
  is also available from the R/qtl website:
