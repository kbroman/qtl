The current implementation of R/qtl-MQM has the following 
limitations: (1) MQM is limited to experimental crosses F2, 
BC, and selfed RIL, (2) MQM does not treat sex
chromosomes differently from autosomal chromosomes - though one can
introduce sex as a cofactor. Future versions of R/qtl-MQM may improve on
these points. Check the website and change log
(\url{http://www.rqtl.org/STATUS.txt}) for updates.
